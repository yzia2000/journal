It's performance review week at Glints and the idea of evaluating engineers
has always been amusing to me. What metrics can you use? Are Slack
messages, Jira cards, number of commits, lines of code valid sources
to measure productivity and impact? Do productivity and impact even
dictate the performance of an engineer? I am told that there are
various forms of literature out there on areas to evaluate performance
on. Heck, there are also firm believers that metrics are not the right
way to evaluate people because they will be bound by those metrics and
will not be incentivised to be creative about how they can help the business.

Performance review aside, something I have been pondering over is the
connection between a developer and an athlete. I watch soccer, boxing, esports
and bodybuilding sometimes and we usually talk about whether athletes
are in-form, in-shape and contributing to the team. There are some
days when athletes play so well that we wonder why they are not higher
in the leaderboard. Sometimes their primary value is to be the playmaker
and create chances for the team to succeed. Sometimes athletes perform
much worse in high pressure scenarios but can really surprise you in
spars, training and friendly matches. I can go on and on but the
underlying theme I have noticed is that much of this conversation
could also extend to us engineers.

Just like athletes there are days when we are in-form. I am sure people
reading can relate that on certain days, you have noticed that you
are on a spree rolling out production code left and right. The release notes
are filled with your commits and closing Jira cards is a new
high. But something happens and suddenly, you are more distracted,
cannot seem to code, suffering from decision paralysis over the most
simple choices. Why are there such marked differences in productivity
over a long period of time? Why are there some people on GitHub
that I see churning commits out by the 100s every day such that their
GitHub tree is as green as a rain-forest but I can't seem to find the
time to make the same kind of contributions?

This would be a great segue to talk about healthy habits, diet and drinking
enough water but I am not gonna do that. I feel such advice is too
frequently distributed. Instead I am gonna focus on an aspect that
engineers draw the most benefit from, like athletes, which is momentum.

Athletes build momentum by winning smaller competitions and matches, doing well
at training. Winning makes you win. This word is thrown around a lot in sports
circles. "X player has developed quite a momentum. They
might certainly surprise us tonight". In a similar capacity, I have
noticed momentum playing a huge role in my productivity as a dev. Start
out on quick wins, to bigger projects. Knowing that your project is
gaining traction. You are making a significant impact in your company. People
are messaging you non-stop for queries and you are setting new standards
at work. Talking just Jira cards, I had finally built up momentum in the
middle of the quarter to complete like 5 cards a sprint and things
were going really well. There were fewer things to pick out on during
retrospectives. Then I had a trip to Turkey for a week with my
family and it is clear that the momentum was lost. How do I get it back?

One note that I have for managers out there is to constantly remind
your engineers of how much impact they are creating because we will
overthink things enough to reduce our motivation levels. Being told
that you are doing well sometimes actually makes us do well and
fill into those shoes to finally perform.

Open-source/personal projects have also been a way for me to gain back momentum.
I am able to use the throughput and creativity to increase my motivation levels
which translates to my productivity at work. A fresh new project can give
you a different perspective and I feel has a tendency to help me work
harder at work than distract me. I would like to think of them
as training camps that athletes go through before a match.

Another underfocused attribute is team chemistry. I feel having
frequent 1-1s with my teammates, knowing about them as more
than just coworkers and going out to dinner with them every now
and then can significantly improve your chemistry. I have
seen that no chemistry can very easily extend to no communication,
more frequent misunderstandings and more conversations in bad
faith. Just like athletes, working well in a team rather than
as an individual can sometimes make it more likely for you to
win.

In powerlifting, athletes have a very precise programme to follow
before the actual lift. What weight they use to warmup? What do
they eat before and on the day of the lift? As devs we talk about
coffee days, songs we listen to while coding amongst others. Is
there scope to be more precise here? I don't know but the reader
can feel free to chime in.

One big difference between a lot of athletes and us devs is that
we are expected to be consistent for a longer period of time
while athletes are mostly expected to perform well on a certain day.
Hence, knowing yourself and what keeps your productivity
levels up is extremely important. As for me, it all goes down
in this journal for future reference.
